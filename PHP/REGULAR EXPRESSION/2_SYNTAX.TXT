Syntax
----------------
In PHP, regular expressions are strings composed of delimiters, a pattern and optional modifiers.

$exp = "/vit/i";


In the example above,
/ is the delimiter,
vit is the pattern that is being searched for
i is a modifier that makes the search case-insensitive.

The delimiter can be any character that is not a letter, number, backslash or space. The most common delimiter is the forward slash (/), but when your pattern contains forward slashes it is convenient to choose other delimiters such as # or ~.


Regular expression syntax includes the use of special characters.
The characters that are given special meaning within a regular expression, are: . * ? + [ ] ( ) { } ^ $ | \. 
You will need to backslash these characters whenever you want to use them literally.
For example, if you want to match ".", you'd have to write \.. 
All other characters automatically assume their literal meanings.
