    <h3>The div element</h3>

    The div element is often used as a container for other HTML elements.
        
    The div element has no required attributes, but style, class and id are common.
        
    When used together with CSS, the div element can be used to style blocks of content:

    <div style="background-color:black;color:white;">
        <h4>London</h4>
        <p>London is the capital city of England. It is the most populous city in the United Kingdom, with a metropolitan area of over 13 million inhabitants.</p>
    </div> 


    <h3>The span Element</h3>

        The span element is an inline container used to mark up a part of a text, or a part of a document.
        
        The span element has no required attributes, but style, class and id are common.
        
        When used together with CSS, the span element can be used to style parts of the text:
