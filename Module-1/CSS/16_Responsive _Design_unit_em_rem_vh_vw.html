   <h1> What Is Responsive Design?</h1>

   <p>Have you ever noticed that websites nowadays adjust themselves according to the resolution of your device(Smartphone, tablet, or desktop computer)? Isn't it amazing that a website is automatically changing its height and width according to the size of the user's screen? This is possible because of the responsive design. Let's dive deep into responsive design.</p>
<p> Responsive design is a way for a web developer to make a website adapt to all the devices and resolutions.</p>

   <p> Endless new resolutions and devices are challenging to support separately for a web developer; therefore, responsive design is the best approach to develop a website that can adjust itself according to the screen size.
    Responsive design is a necessity and not a luxury anymore!</p>

   
<h3>Various Ways To Achieve Responsive Design :</h3>

<ul>

    <li> By using rem/vh/vw units over pixels.</li>
    <li>By using max-width/max-height.</li>
    <li>Using CSS Media Queries.</li>
    <li>Setting up the viewport.</li>
</ul>
   


<h4>em- </h4>
<ul><li>Font-sizes are inherited relative to the parent element.</li>
<li>10em means ten times of the parent element.</li></ul>

    
<h4>rem-</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Font-size gets set according to the font-size of the root element.</li>
    <li>In general, &lt html &gt is the root element.</li>
    <li>In rem, "r" stands for "root."</li>
</ul>
    
<h4>vh- </h4>
<ul>
    <li>It stands for viewport height.</li>
    <li>vh is equal to the 1/100 times of the viewport height.</li>
    <li>Example: Suppose height of the browser is 1000px, so 1vh is equaled to (1/100)*1000= 10px.</li>
</ul>
    

<h4>vw-</h4>
<ul>
    <li>It stands for viewport width.</li>
    <li>Similar to vh, vw is equal to the 1/100 times of the viewport width.</li>
    <li> Example: Suppose width of the browser is 1000px, so 1vw is equaled to (1/100)*1000= 10px.</li>
</ul>
